# Genetic Algorithms Module

This module provides the core components required to build and run **Genetic Algorithms (GA)** in Java.

---

##  Overview

Genetic Algorithms are optimization and search techniques inspired by natural evolution.  
This module allows you to:

- Define chromosomes and genes  
- Evaluate fitness  
- Apply mutation and crossover  
- Manage populations  
- Run evolutionary cycles  
- Train neural networks using GA
